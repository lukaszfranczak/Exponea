Repository with assignment solutions

I divided all of the tasks into two parts:
1. Tasks 1-5 in which I was meant to concentrate on showing a particular result in the console
2. Task which does the A/B test in which a button color is assigned

Each part has it's own script - in case of part 1 it's the Part1.js script, in case of part 2 - Part2.js :)

Assumptions:
- as I used the IIFE with the arrow function my scripts won't work on IE, so non-IE browser is recommended :)
